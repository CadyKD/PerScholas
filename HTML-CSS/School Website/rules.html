		<h1>General Rules</h1>
		<div class="left">
			<ul>
				<li>Do not disrespect the moderators, they are here to make sure all rules are followed, maintain the boards 
				and/or website, and answer questions.</li>
				<li>This is a play by post RPG. This means that you write a post on what your character is doing on a certain day. 
				Be descriptive in posting, if you arent, then you don't gain anything because: This site isn't about getting powerful, 
				its about HOW you get powerful. The whole story is important, not the end result, thats least important.</li>
				<li>NO POWER GAMING! This goes for your characters and your villains too, any characters that are so powerful they have an
				effect on everyone should be NPC's.</li>
				<li>Multiple characters are allowed, each has to be submitted for approval before it will be added to your profile. 
				Characters may be part of the same story or completely seperate stories.</li>
				<li>No copyrighted characters, AT ALL! If the character was created by someone else, it is not allowed. This is NOT 
				a fan-fic site. (Characters with similar abilities or based on similar ideas to copyrighted work are okay but frowned
				upon if discovered, try to be creative and invent your own work)</li>
				<li>No duplicate characters. If someone else is already playing a character you cannot replicate that character.</li>
				<li>Try to have fun!</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h1>Penalities</h1>
		<div class="left">
			<ul>
				<li>Vary depending on the severity of the offense and the number of offenses accrued, anything from a warning
				to being banned.</li>
			</ul>
